 - My name is Anthony and I'm currently working towards my Computer Science degree (Dec 2024) and dabbling in various projects.
 - I've been a self-taught hobbyist programmer for 10 years and have experience in Unity, Unreal Engine blueprints, Arduino and C/C++/C#/Java/Python languages.
 - I'm very interested in working with AI or XR related, but I'm just overall happy when I'm working on projects with other people.
 - I've participated in GameJams with both large and small teams and thrive in the close team environment when I can bring ideas to life with the people around me.

 - I can be contacted at thepallitta@gmail.com, but I am most active on Discord at Salty#4528.
