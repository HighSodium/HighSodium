 - My name is Anthony Pallitta and I'm currently working towards my Computer Science degree and dabbling in various projects.
I've been a self-taught hobbyist programmer for about 10 years now and have experience in Unity, Unreal Engine 4 blueprints, Arduino and C/C++/C#/Java languages.
I'm very interested in working with VR and anything 'experience' related, but I'm a happy camper just to be working with other people.
I've participated in a few GameJams with small teams and larger teams and thrive in that environment.

I can be contacted at thepallitta@gmail.com, but I am most active on Discord at Salty#4528.
